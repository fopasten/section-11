## Example 4: Compromised Readiness — Modify Recommended

```
Data last_updated (UTC): 2026-01-23T07:55:40

Weather (Klampenborg): 🌫 1°C, 91% humidity, Fog, wind 2.1 m/s from the east.
Coach note: Gloomy and damp — indoor day.

Current Status Summary:
RHR: 50 bpm (baseline: 46 bpm)
HRV: 42 ms (7d avg: 54 ms)
Sleep Hours: 5.20 hours
Sleep Quality: 4/4
TSB: -12.80
CTL: 74.90
ATL: 87.70
ACWR: 1.17 (optimal)
Ramp Rate: 1.10
Monotony: 2.5 — elevated, add variety this week
Load/Recovery: 7.1 (tolerance 6.4) — over threshold; back off today.
Polarization: Z1+Z2 93%, Z3 2%, Z4+ 5% — Polarized (PI: 2.85) | TID drift: shifting (28d Pyramidal)
Durability: 5.80% 7d mean (declining) — 3 qualifying sessions ⚠️
Total hours, last 7 days: 18.40 hours
Total activities, last 7 days: 14
Total TSS, last 7 days: 612

Planned Workouts for Today (Planned TSS: 90):
Threshold 1.5h — 3x12min @ 260W

Recommendation: Modify

Interpretation:
Readiness: Compromised. HRV 42 is 22% below 7d average, RHR spiked to 50 (+4 above baseline),
and sleep was poor at 5.2h with 4/4 quality. Multiple amber/red signals.
Load/Recovery over threshold at 7.1, monotony elevated at 2.5, and durability declining (5.8% mean
decoupling, up from 3.2% 28d avg) — body is absorbing a heavy week and aerobic efficiency is slipping.
Swap threshold intervals for an easy endurance ride (Z2, 1.5h, ~50 TSS). Save the intensity
for when readiness recovers. Listen to your body today. 🛑
