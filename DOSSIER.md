## 2. TRAINING BACKGROUND
- **Experience:** 7 years cycling (on/off); 6 months consistent rigorous training.
- **Volume:** 8–10 hours cycling/week + 2–3 hours Bouldering/week.
- **Typical Week:**
  - Tue/Thu: Quality (Threshold/Tempo/VO2).
  - Sat/Sun: Long rides (Volume focus).
  - Other: Active recovery or Z2 volume.

## 3. GOALS & OBJECTIVES
- **Primary:** Consistent FTP growth and general fitness.
- **Secondary:** Long-distance endurance capacity and body composition (getting leaner).

## 4. CONSTRAINTS & HEALTH
- **Injury History:** Occasional knee discomfort on high-climbing days.
- **Biomechanical:** Lower back pain when climbing hard in a seated position.
- **Availability:** Flexible schedule, but moves sessions based on feel/RPE.

## 5. PREFERENCES
- **Style:** Hybrid. Structured plans with power ranges + HR caps, but flexible based on RPE and daily readiness.
- **Environment:** Mostly outdoor training; indoor direct-drive trainer used for winter/off-season.ø
